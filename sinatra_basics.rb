	"An introduction to rapidly prototyping web-based products and services. This 7-week experience will teach students the basics of web development for online services. Specifically, well focus on lightweight, minimal UI, microservices (e.g. bots, conversational interfaces, platform integrations, designing micro-interactions, etc.) Well introduce and examine these new web service trends and interactive experiences. Students will learn through instructor led workshops and hands-on experimentation. As an intro level course, no knowledge of programming is needed. By the end of the course, students will be able to design, prototype and deploy their own web-delivered services."
